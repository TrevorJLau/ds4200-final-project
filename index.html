    <h1> Visualizing Environmental Inequities: <br> Pollution and Household Income Dynamics </h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

    <p>Exploring the intricate relationship between environmental pollution and median household income in the United
        States is vital for understanding the broader dynamics of environmental justice and economic inequality.
        Pollution, manifesting in various forms such as air and water contaminants, does not impact all communities
        equally. It disproportionately affects those in lower economic brackets, highlighting a stark intersection of
        environmental degradation and social inequality. This complex interplay reveals how geographical location and
        economic status can influence exposure to environmental risks, making it a crucial area of study for advocating
        for equitable environmental policies and practices.</p>

    <p>Through the lens of interactive visualizations, this project aims to illuminate the patterns, trends, and
        correlations between pollution levels across different pollutants and median household income. By visualizing
        these dynamics, we can uncover the nuanced ways in which environmental harm and economic conditions intersect,
        providing a clearer understanding of the distribution of environmental burdens. Such insights are essential for
        formulating targeted interventions aimed at mitigating pollution exposure in vulnerable communities and
        fostering a more sustainable and equitable future for all.</p>

    <p>Addressing environmental inequities requires a comprehensive examination of the factors at play, including
        economic disparities, regulatory frameworks, and the historical context of land use and industrial placement. By
        correlating pollution data with household income, this project seeks to highlight areas of concern where
        environmental injustices may be most pronounced. This endeavor not only sheds light on the current state of
        environmental equity but also serves as a call to action for policymakers, community leaders, and citizens to
        engage in concerted efforts towards addressing these critical issues, ensuring that environmental health and
        prosperity are accessible to all, regardless of economic standing.</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> Our analysis makes use of two datasets. the first data is
        a data set called `pollution_2000_2021.csv` which contains
        the following pollution statistics for the US states between 2000 and 2021.
        The second data set is called `income` and contains median household income data by state for the years 1984 to
        2018. After combining the two data sets, our combined data has <b> xxx </b> rows with 7
        features and covers the years 2000-2018. The detailed information about the features are listed
        in the following table:</p>

    <div class="center">
        <table class="tg">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th class="tg-0lax">Variable Name</th>
                    <th class="tg-0lax">Details</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>

                </tr>

            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>We also incorporated geographical data into our analysis. Thus, we also made use of<a
            href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a> for making maps of US states.
    </p>

    <p> Following is an interactive map for the states in US. Users can zoom in and pan around the map. The left graph
        is a scattergeo showing the different pollutant levels by size and state. The right graph is a chloropleth
        and the color represents median household income by state. When hovering over any
        state, exact numbers are shown in a tooltip. The data shown on the maps is filtered by year and can be adjusted
        using the dropdown menu in the top left. </p>

    <h3>Overview of the Pollution Rate</h3>
    <div class='text'>
        <p> First, we present an overview of the O3 pollution rate
            for all the states with data:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class='container'>
        <div class='image'>
            <img src="histogram.png" width="960px" height="550px" frameborder="0"></img>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class='text'>
        <p> We noticed that there is considerable variation between the states, with some having over
            double the level of O3 pollution compared to other states. This variation can be influenced by the
            geographical location, urbanization level, industrial activity, and transportation patterns in each state.
            For example, Alaska has the lowest average O3 pollution among the states listed. This could be attributed to
            its remote location, lower population density, and lesser industrial activity compared to other states.
            Massachusetts is another state with relatively low average O3 pollution that stuck out to us. It is known
            for its investment in technology and education, which might play a role in its lower pollution levels.
            Texas was also notable for its moderate O3 levels. Texas has a large number of oil refineries and chemical
            plants, especially in the Houston area, which we would expect to contribute to its ozone levels. However,
            the stateâ€™s large size likely helps to bring down the ppm average for the state.
            Finally, Tennessee appeared at the top of the list likely due to having several major urban areas, including
            Nashville, Memphis, and Knoxville, which have dense traffic and industrial activities. The emissions from
            vehicles and factories in these areas are likely contributors to higher levels of ozone.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3> The Relationship Between Pollution Rate and Median Income</h3>

    <div class='text'>
        <p>Moreover, we also want to examine the relationship between
            pollution rate and median household income In order to do so, we ran a regression on each pollutant with
            state median income for 2018 data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the regressions shown by the plots, we don't see a clear pattern, suggesting that there may not
            be a straightforward or strong linear relationship between median income and pollution levels for any of
            the pollutants. In fact, we noticed that there is even a downward slope for O3, suggesting that higher
            income levels may even be associated with factors that contribute to lower O3 emissions, such as newer
            vehicles with better emission controls, transitions to cleaner energy sources, or more effective
            environmental policies.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class='image'>
        <img src="regression.png" width="900px" height="650px" frameborder="0"></img>
    </div>

    <p>We have also created a line plot to show how the pollutant levels changed over time. For these charts, we show
        the full range of pollutant data from 2000 to 2021. Firstly, we are able to see a steady decrease in mean pollutant
        levels for carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, with each at least 50 percent lower
        than their highs in the early 2000s. However, we cannot see the same decrease in ground ozone levels which have
        remained relatively consistent the last 21 years. This may be due to ground ozone not usually being
        emitted directly, but rather forms from chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic
        compounds in sunlight. Since it is usually not man-made, the advent of stricter emission regulations in the
        2000s might not have had the same limiting effect on ground ozone compared to other air pollutants.

    <h3>Compare MA to the Other States</h3>

    <p>
        Because we all live in Massachusetts, we thought that it would be interesting to take a closer look
        how pollution and household income in MA compares to other states. We created the
        following interactive plot such that users can choose another state to compare with MA
        and show a bar plot for each pollution factor and median household income.

    <h3>Summary and Additional Work</h3>

    <p>
        In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US
        pollution rate across states. We also examine the relation
        between pollution rate and median household income.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, we weren't able to determine any strong relationships between pollution and income. However, we
        did notice that there seems to be a relationship between population and pollution. For future work, we would
        like to further explore how pollution relates to other socioeconomic factors like population, vehicle traffic,
        industrial activity, housing density, etc. We also think that it would be beneficial to widen our scope to look
        at county data as opposed to state data in order to get a more nuanced view.
